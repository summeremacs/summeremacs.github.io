My current (mostly 80s) movies/shows watch list. Now, i've seen a few of these already, but the goal is to 1) see it together with my GF and 2) to /also/ watch it together with our BFFs. Some of them have been seen by my GF or one of my BFFs - they remain unchecked until we've all seen it together. Usually, we dress up in 80s fashion and makeup for a weekend night or day and watch a few of them back to back. It's a fun 80s retro party that way. ðŸ™ƒ

This list will continue being updated as time goes on. Also: any of my friends online can suggest things for me to put on the list. It can be 70s and 60s too, btw. It just started as an 80s list at first. ðŸ™ƒ

Feel free to contact me to add stuff to this list!
