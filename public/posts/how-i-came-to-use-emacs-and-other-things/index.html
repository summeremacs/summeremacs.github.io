<p>I&#39;m tired of repeating myself so I&#39;m writing this down so I don&#39;t have to. You&#39;re probably only here if you asked me how I came to learn about Emacs and the CLI and other things. Well, this is the story:</p>
<p>
It begins with a Pandemic. <em>The</em> Pandemic. Yes, that one.</p>
<p>
I know it&#39;s a long time ago now for most people, but that&#39;s where it starts. It feels like a lifetime ago for me. I was a first year overseas person working for a company to manage things, However, halfway through my time there, the Pandemic hit.</p>
<p>
Paris was locked down. Everything was closed. And I mean <em>everything</em>. It wasn&#39;t like in the states - we had to have permission slips to go outside for an hour max a day (there were exceptions but most people stuck to the rules). Cafes, restaurants, stores - everything was closed. Of course, it being France, they opened the tobacco shops back up first but everything else remained closed. (Crazy, inorite?)</p>
<p>
At that point, my Western Digital &#34;Network Drive&#34; died. It was non-responsive. I had a lot of stuff on there so I was pretty mad about that. Note: I&#39;ll never trust &#34;Network Drives&#34; again. ðŸ˜›</p>
<p>
So, I needed to fix it. But I didn&#39;t know how. I couldn&#39;t get it fixed at a shop because no shops were open. Also, I was paid a pretty small salary at the time so I couldn&#39;t really afford to spend hundreds of euros getting it fixed or recovered.</p>
<p>
A friend of mine who works in tech told me to buy a Raspberry Pi because Linux could fix my drive or recover my info. I had heard of these things, but barely and very vaguely. But anyway, I followed her directions and I bought one online. It was delivered to me in a few days (I guess they had nothing better to do and deliveries were up all over the place).</p>
<p>
So there I was, sitting on the floor of my living room, the Raspberry Pi hooked up to my TV. Anyway, it took me about a week to look stuff up on my MacBook Pro and figure out how to recover my stuff. <em>Believe me</em> it was hard. I had to learn about &#39;df&#39; and &#39;du&#39; and &#39;fdisk&#39; and sectors and partitions - all stuff I had never, ever, heard about before. The only things I had were my computers and online sites that talked about this stuff in, honestly, really cryptic ways.</p>
<p>
Anyway, I eventually got it to work after a week of pulling my hair out, sitting cross-legged on the floor. But it worked and I recovered 100% of my drive. <strong>100%!</strong> It was at like 2 or 3am (I honestly can&#39;t remember) and I ran around my apartment laughing and shouting with joy.</p>
<p>
My neighbours politely never remarked on this or complained.</p>
<p>
So then what happened? Well, I had this new thing in my life: My Raspberry Pi. I figuredâ€¦maybe I can use it for stuff. I also figured that this would <strong>never</strong> happen to me again. So I learned about how to make an NAS system with my Pi, and I bought some drives to do that. I watched a lot of videos on Linux and the Raspberry Pi on how to set up an NAS. And I learned about much more involving Linux and that led me to Emacs (even before Vim). See, I was using Nano before and I didn&#39;t know what else there was. But I came across a video demonstrating Org Mode and I was blown away. The video was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4"> Getting Started With Org Mode</a> by <a href="https://harryrschwartz.com">Harry Schwartz</a>. I mean it really, <em>really</em> blew me away. I don&#39;t know why because his screen is so ugly, but the things you could do with text - I had never seen that before. Ever. Also, he just sounds like such a nice person in the presentation. Anyway, I was totally hooked.</p>
<p>
So I installed Emacs on my MacBook which was still working fine of course. And then I learned about other things.</p>
<p>
First, I started learning about <a href="https://www.spacemacs.org">Spacemacs</a> because I saw some posts on Reddit how it was easier for newbies. Then, I switched to <a href="https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs">Doom Emacs</a>, because I heard it was faster. But then, after a very short time (and getting tired of Doom breaking every update), I went all vanilla. The videos which helped me the most in doing that (and also learning Org-Mode) were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mzamansky">Mike Zamansky</a> for setting up Emacs from scratch with an org-mode config.org file. Also great quick video reviews of different packages.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@koenighaunstetten">Rainer KÃ¶nig</a> for learning all things org-mode. He&#39;s amazing, and he sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger. (He is aware of this)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SystemCrafters">System Crafters</a> for learning extra deep stuff in Emacs and much longer videos explaining them (such as setting up mu4e in depth and other things). Also, he&#39;s got a great community on <a href="https://matrix.org">Matrix</a> and you can find his web page at <a href="https://systemcrafters.net">System Crafters</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, in one of the communities online, I met a guy named <a href="https://universeodon.com/@remi">Remi</a> and he helped me with some CLI (Command Line Interface) stuff as well as Emacs in many ways.</p>
<p>
Eventually that led me to my new job (which is not tech at all) because of a personal interaction I had with somebody thanks to learning about Linux/online communities. This was totally random but it wouldn&#39;t have happened without me getting involved in online communities. My job has nothing to do with tech really, but I wouldn&#39;t have met my new boss without going to find something out at the right place and right time. Also, I use Emacs in my job every day to organise things and I can&#39;t live without it.</p>
<p>
I have taken my MacBook Pro to bed with me a couple of times just to feel Emacs close to me.</p>
<p>
So that&#39;s how I learned about Emacs and a little bit of CLI and Linux at first.</p>
<p>
I hope you enjoyed reading it.</p>
<p>
Summer.</p>
