All my server stuff in Emacs

<p>Today, I wanted to tidy up some stuff on my server. I had a ton of photos and videos I wanted to organize on my servers. Also, it was getting a little messy with my old way of doing the directories because I had set it up before I had learned how to do most of the things that I know how to do. You see, I have a main drive on my main server, and then a backup drive off of it. But it was a bit messy. I&#39;d dump stuff in one directory as a temp storage place at the root of that directory, but I never did the <code class="verbatim">--delete</code> flags for <code class="verbatim">rsync</code> which meant that I&#39;d have to, every now and then, go into my backup drive and just delete all the trash by hand. I never had the time to fix that. I only learned a few things about rsync when I had set it up and even though I set up another rsync with the <code class="verbatim">--delete</code> flag, I never had the time to do a <code class="verbatim">--dry-run</code> on the important stuff I wanted to update. I&#39;d never use a flag like that without doing a dry run. Ever.</p>

<h2 id="headline-2">
Emacs to the rescue!
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Okay, so what did I do? First, I used <code class="verbatim">TRAMP</code> in Emacs to ssh right into my server directly as <code class="verbatim">sudo</code>. The guys from <a href="https://systemcrafters.net">System Crafters</a> on Matrix taught me how to use <code class="verbatim">TRAMP</code> with <code class="verbatim">sudo</code> just yesterday. I had it in my notes in denote, so I put the knowledge to good use. I pulled up <code class="verbatim">vterm</code> and did <code class="verbatim">mosh</code> into my main server across the country. Then I did an <code class="verbatim">rsync</code> command on one of the <code class="verbatim">origin</code> and <code class="verbatim">target</code> directories after looking it up in my notes and verifying it in <code class="verbatim">crontab</code> on my server. I used a <code class="verbatim">&gt; rsync.txt</code> command to pipe the result to my home directory and ran the command. I knew it would take a few minutes to run because I had moved around a lot of stuff - that&#39;s okay. Time enough for me to use <code class="verbatim">TRAMP</code> to open it up in Emacs, and hit my refresh buffer global key (F5) that I use a lot.</p>
<p>
I could see the output live and go over it with a fine-toothed comb. I was making sure it wasn&#39;t erasing everything and messing up.</p>
<p>
Yay! No problems with the command! ðŸ¥³</p>
<p>
So then, thanks to my learning about piping and all that other safety stuff, I was able to run the <code class="verbatim">rsync</code> command again, without the <code class="verbatim">--dry-run</code> line, still piping it to a new log so I can keep an eye out live on it since I have the <code class="verbatim">--progress</code> flag on that command (on all of them).</p>
<p>
All from Emacs!</p>
<p>
Stuff I put to good use:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="verbatim">rsync --delete --dry-run --progress</code></li>
<li><code class="verbatim">TRAMP</code> with <code class="verbatim">sudo</code> and regular login too</li>
<li><code class="verbatim">vterm</code></li>
<li><code class="verbatim">crontab</code></li>
<li>piping with &gt; !</li>
</ul>
<p>I know I said I wouldn&#39;t write much on this blog, but I feel so amazing after having done that all so flawlessly with Emacs that I just couldn&#39;t help myself. ðŸ™ƒ</p>
<p>
P.S. I know this was mostly about rsync but it wouldn&#39;t have happened without my learning how to use <code class="verbatim">sudo</code> with <code class="verbatim">TRAMP</code> yesterday. It&#39;s that which prompted me to learn to edit files with root access on my server (crontab) that made it possible for me to easily start working on it. And since <code class="verbatim">TRAMP</code> is so awesome, I had to give it all the credit. ðŸ™ƒ</p>
