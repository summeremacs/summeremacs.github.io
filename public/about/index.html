Ok, so what? Well, I made a huge fuss about never making a blog. But after over a year of being bothered about it, I finally did! Good job guys! 🤣
So, why? Well, it&#39;s because uploading org files in raw format to my Github account was looking kinda shoddy. And, as many people know, I do NOT like to look shoddy.
So, it was prompted by a few comments online (like here for instance) which just made me hide my face in my hands 🤦🏼‍♀️ and say ok…screw it. I&#39;ll make a blog. But I didn&#39;t wanna pay for a Squarespace or something like that because anyone with 1/4 of a brain can do that and &#34;make a blog&#34;. Instead, since I was posting about Emacs stuff (mostly), I wanted it to be where I can get geek cred: 👩🏼‍💻 on Github. So, I had to set up Hugo and also easy-hugo for Emacs (yes, I linked to a Mac 🍏 version. Bite me! 😀), and then I had to look through tons of bad themes to find a good one and figure out how to set that up, and boy was that not easy to do!

Hi there!

<p>You&#39;re reading my blog.</p>
<p>
Ok, so what? Well, I made a huge fuss about <em>never</em> making a blog. But after <em>over a year of being bothered about it</em>, I finally did! Good job guys! 🤣</p>
<p>
So, why? Well, it&#39;s because uploading <code class="verbatim">org</code> files in raw format to my <a href="https://www.github.com/summeremacs">Github account</a> was looking kinda shoddy. And, as many people know, I do <em>NOT</em> like to look shoddy.</p>
<p>
So, it was prompted by a few comments online (like <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/2hswwc/how_i_came_use_emacs_other_things">here for instance</a>) which just made me hide my face in my hands 🤦🏼‍♀️ and say ok…screw it. I&#39;ll make a blog. But I didn&#39;t wanna pay for a Squarespace or something like that because anyone with 1/4 of a brain can do that and &#34;make a blog&#34;. Instead, since I was posting about Emacs stuff (mostly), I wanted it to be where I can get geek cred: 👩🏼‍💻 on Github. So, I had to set up <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> and also <a href="https://github.com/masasam/emacs-easy-hugo">easy-hugo</a> for <a href="https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus">Emacs</a> (yes, I linked to a Mac 🍏 version. Bite me! 😀), and then I had to look through tons of bad themes to find a good one and figure out how to set that up, and boy was that not easy to do!</p>
<p>
Eventually, I &#34;made it work&#34;.</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t finished. I do have a DNS to tie to it but I don&#39;t think that I&#39;ll bother for now. I just want it to park stuff I&#39;ve already written and maybe will write about every few months or year or so. We&#39;ll see.</p>
<p>
At least it doesn&#39;t look as shoddy 🗑️ as before.</p>
<p>
